# Geometry Dash
Recreating RobTop's Worldwide game famously known as Geometry Dash

## **Overview**
### Gameplay
Geometry Dash basically uses a keyboard or a  mouse to control different vehicles that react when a player uses the jump function by either pressing the spacebar or up arrow on a keyboard, left-clicking with the mouse, or pressing A on the controller. Users cannot control the speed at which the icon is moving. The timing and rhythm of the in-game music are key parts of the game, often in relation to each other. The objective of the game is to complete a level by reaching its end. If the player crashes into an obstacle, they will have to resume the game from a few meters prior.
### What does our group put forward?
Our version of Geometry Dash will be a multiplayer game that allows there to be a minimum of 2 players where the competitors compete to reach the finish line first.
