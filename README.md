# PacMan Rush
Creating the classic PacMan with multiplayer twist!

## **Overview**
### Gameplay
PacMan is a maze arcade game where the player controls the PacMan with the objective of eating all the dots while avoiding several ghosts which try to follow you. PacMan dies upon coming on contact with any of the ghosts and must try to eat all the dots in the enclosed maze. We are adding a multiplayer twist in the game which allows 2 player to go head to head. The one that stays alive with most lives and eats the most dots wins the game.
